= The Linux Kernel
Zilogic Systems

== Development Process

=== Kernel Sources

  * The kernel sources can be obtained from http://kernel.org

  * The mainline git repository of the Linux can be obtained using
+
-------
git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git
-------
+
  * Each subsystem maintainer has a separate tree

  * Subsystem specific tree can be obtained from `MAINTAINERS`


=== Kernel Versioning Scheme

image::figures/kernel-releases.png[width="35%",align="center"]


=== Kernel Development Process

  * A new development cycle starts after a release of a stable kernel

  * Version number is chosen for the next stable kernel, say 4.23

  * Merge window is open for 2 weeks

  * Maintainers submit feature additions for inclusion into the kernel

  * At the close of the merge window, Linus releases `4.23-rc1`

=== Kernel Development Process (Contd.)

  * Over period of 6 - 10 weeks, only bugfixes can be submitted

  * Linus releases an RC kernel every week

  * Kernels are named `4.23-rc2`, `4.23-rc3`, and so on

  * When the kernel is deemed sufficiently stable, Linux releases `4.23`

=== Kernel Development Process (Contd.)

  * A new development cycle starts for `4.24`

  * Development of the stable kernel is passed on to the "stable
    team", consisting of Greg KH

  * Only bug fixes are accepted into the stable kernel

  * Stable kernels are released 2 - 3 times a month

  * Stable kernels are numbered `4.23.1`, `4.23.2`, etc.


=== Try Out

  * Pre-downloaded kernel for the workshop is available from
+
------
/usr/share/buildroot-vybrid/linux-4.4.39.tar.xz
------
+
  * Copy the kernel to the home directory and extract the kernel
+
------
cp /usr/share/buildroot-vybrid/linux-4.4.39.tar.xz .
tar -x -f linux-4.4.39.tar.xz
------

=== Try Out

  * The kernel needs to be patched.
+
------
cd linux-4.4.39
PATCH_DIR="/usr/share/buildroot-vybrid/patches/linux"
patch -p1 < $PATCH_DIR/0001-linux-toradex.patch
patch -p1 < $PATCH_DIR/0002-linux-zilogic.patch
patch -p1 < $PATCH_DIR/0003-linux-rndis.patch
------

== Kernel Build

=== Pre-build Check

  * Tools required to build the kernel is specified in
    `Documentation/Changes`

  * Need to ensure that tools of required version is installed

=== Toolchain

  * Codesourcery's ARM cross toolchain is installed within the Vagrant
    box

  * Cross-compiler prefix: `arm-none-linux-gnueabi-`

  * Will be used for cross-compiling the Linux kernel

=== Kernel Configuration

  * Configuring the kernel specifies

    - what features are required
    - what are not required
    - what features are required as modules

=== Kernel Configuration (Contd.)

  * Pre-canned configurations are available and can be invoked using
    `make` targets with `_defconfig` suffix
+
------
export ARCH=arm
make zkit_arm_vf51_defconfig
------
+
  * Creates `.config` containing the selected configuration

=== Kernel Build

  * Command to build the kernel.
+
-----
export CROSS_COMPILE=arm-none-linux-gnueabi-
make -j4
-----
+
   * Command to build the uImage
+
-----
make uImage LOADADDR=0x80008000
-----

=== Try Out

  * Build the kernel and generate the uImage
  * Verify that the kernel image is available from
    `arch/arm/boot/uImage`
  * Copy the kernel to `/tftpboot`
  * Boot Vybrid board to verify that the kernel boots

=== Kernel Configuration Changes

  * The kernel displays a version number at bootup.

  * This can be customized by changing the following configuration.
+
------
General Setup >
	() Local version - append to kernel release
------
+
  * Add a custom string in this configuration.

  * Look for this string in your kernel boot log.

=== Try Out

  * Make the mentioned configuration changes

  * Build, boot and verify that the configuration changes have taken
    effect

=== Clean Targets

  * Sometimes it is required to do a clean build of the kernel

  * There are various `make` targets to remove the generated files
    from the source tree

    - `clean`: Removes files generated as part of the build process
    - `mrproper`: `clean` + remove `.config`
    - `distclean`: `mrproper` + patch files + backup files

  * Order of greater cleanliness
    - `distclean > mrproper > clean`
