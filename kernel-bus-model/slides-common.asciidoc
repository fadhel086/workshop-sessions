== Hotplug

=== Hotplug Buses

  * Hotplug is the ability to connect and disconnect a device on a
    running system.

  * Some busses are hotplug capable, while others are not.

  * Examples of busses that support hotplug - USB, Firewire, cPCI, 
    etc.

  * Examples of busses that do not support hotplug - system bus, ISA
    bus, I2C, etc.

=== OS Support

  * With hotplug capable busses the devices can be connected after
    boot-up and the driver should be able to handle the device at any
    time

  * The hotplug capable buses, provide the following capabilities for
    the OS to detect and handle the devices correctly

    1. The bus controller can determine the list of devices connected
       to the bus

    2. The devices on the bus, provide the model no. they belong to,
       usually using a vendor ID and product ID

== Bus Model and Driver Binding

=== Bus Model

image::figures/bus-model-1.png[align="center"]

  * The system keeps track of the devices and drivers for every bus in
    the system

  * This hierarchy of buses and the list of devices and drivers
    pertaining to each bus, is called the bus model

  * The bus model is exported to the user space through the sysfs
    filesystem under `/sys/bus`

=== Adding Device

=== Adding Drivers

image::figures/bus-model-3.png[align="center"]

=== Matching

image::figures/bus-model-4.png[align="center"]

  * When a device is added to the device list, the Bus Driver checks
    if there is a driver that can handle the device.

=== Matching (Contd.)

image::figures/bus-model-5.png[align="center"]

  * When a driver is added to the driver list, the Bus Driver checks
    if there is a device that the driver can handle.

=== Binding

image::figures/bus-model-6.png[align="center"]

  * If a match is found, then the driver's `probe()` function is
    called with the device information as argument

  * If `probe()` is successful, the device is said to be bound to the
    driver

  * Indicated in sysfs, in the driver node

== Generalizing the Bus Model

=== Bus Model for Non-Hotplug Devices

  * Uniform handling of both hotplug and hotplug busses / devices

  * Separate-out machine specific code from the driver

=== Limitations of Non-Hotplug Busses

  * The kernel provides mechanisms to overcome the following
    limitations of buses that are not hotplug capable

    1. The buses cannot detect what devices are present

    2. The devices cannot identify themselves with a vendor ID &
        product ID

=== Overcoming the Limitations

  * The first limitation is overcome by populating the device list at
    boot-up by the board specific code of the kernel

  * The second limitation is overcome by providing a unique string, to
    identify the device. Drivers identify the devices that they
    support using the unique string

=== I2C Bus

image::figures/bus-model-7.png[align="center"]

=== I2C Driver Skeleton

[source,c]
------
include::code/skel-driver/skel-driver.c[]
------

ifdef::kp[]
=== Try Out

  * `rmmod` the `i2c_key` module

  * Get the module
    link:{include:code/skel-driver.tar.gz.datauri}["skel-driver.tar.gz",filename="skel-driver.tar.gz"]

  * Modify the skeleton code so that the `probe()` callback is called
    for the I2C device `zkey`

  * Build the module, and check if the `probe()` is invoked when the
    module is loaded

  * Check `sysfs` to see if the driver is bound to the device
endif::kp[]

ifdef::ldd[]
=== Adding Devices Manually

  * Devices can also be added / removed manually through the `sysfs`

  * Controller device node
+
------
/sys/bus/i2c/devices/i2c-0
------
+
  * Devices can be added by writing to `new_device`
+
------
echo zkey 0x20 > /sys/bus/i2c/devices/i2c-0/new_device
------

=== Removing Devices Manually

  * Devices can be removed by writing to `delete_device`
+
------
echo 0x20 > /sys/bus/i2c/devices/i2c-0/delete_device
------

=== Try Out

  * Check the currently available devices
+
------
ls /sys/bus/i2c/devices
------
+
  * Add an I2C device to the system using `sysfs`
+
------
echo "zkey 0x20" > /sys/bus/i2c/devices/i2c-0/new-device
------
+
  * Check the curently available devices again

=== Try Out

  * Get the module
    link:{include:code/skel-driver.tar.gz.datauri}["skel-driver.tar.gz",filename="skel-driver.tar.gz"]

  * Modify the skeleton code so that the `probe()` callback is called
    for the I2C device `zkey`
+
------
static const struct i2c_device_id skel_id[] = {
	{ "skel-dev-name-1", 0 },
	{ "skel-dev-name-2", 0 },
	{ }
};
------
+
------
static const struct i2c_device_id skel_id[] = {
	{ "zkey", 0 },
	{ }
};
------

=== Try Out

  * Build the module, and load the module

  * Check if the `probe()` is invoked when the module is loaded

  * Check `sysfs` to see if the driver is bound to the device
+
------
ls /sys/bus/i2c/drivers/skel-driver
------

endif::ldd[]

== Module Autoload

=== Autoloading

  * Bus model tells us how a driver starts handling a device, if the
    driver is already loaded

  * If the driver is not already loaded, it should be loaded first

  * Autoloading happens
    - at boot up
    - during device hotplug

=== How does it work?

  * Observations
    - Only userspace is capable of loading modules into the kernel
    - `modprobe` should be invoked to load the required modules

  * Requirements
    . Device hotplug should be notified to user space
    . Userspace should be able to identify the driver for the device

=== Requirement 1: Device Hotplug Notification

  * Device hotplug is notified to user space, through netlink socket

  * When a device is plugged into the system, a message is sent on
    netlink socket

  * Contains information about the device plugged
+
------
bus:vendor-id-product-id
------
+ 
  * Examples
+
------
i2c:zkey
pci:v00000010d00000020
usb:v1044p8005
------

=== Module Loading by Alias

  * Modules can have an alias

  * Aliases for a module can be obtained using `modinfo`

  * Module can be loaded by its filename or by its alias AKA modalias

=== Device Name as Alias

  * Specify the device name as alias of module

  * Module can be loaded either by module name or device it supports
+
------
modprobe usb:v1044p8005
------

=== Module Alias Can Have Wild Cards

  * If modules alias is `usb:v1044p*`

  * Matches devices with vendord ID 0x1044 and any product ID

  * Module can be loaded with any of the following names
    - `modprobe usb:v1044p0001`
    - `modprobe usb:v1044p0002`

=== Requirement 2: Device to Driver Mapping

  * Module alias is picked from the modules

  * Collected to a single file `modules.alias`

  * Provides the reuqired device to driver mapping

=== UDev, Completes the Puzzle

image::figures/autoload.png[align="center",width="50%"]

ifdef::kp[]
=== Try Out

  * Try loading `8139cp` PCI driver with the filename first, in the
    host system (VM)

  * You should use `sudo` to load and unload modules

  * Find out the modalias names for the PCI driver

  * Try loading the driver with the alias names
endif::kp[]

ifdef::ldd[]
=== Try Out

  * On the development system, get the modinfo for `zd1201`
+
-----
/sbin/modinfo ~/linux-4.4.39/drivers/net/wireless/zd1201.ko
-----

=== Try Out

  * On the target board, check the `modules.alias` file
+
-----
cat /lib/modules/4.4.39/module.alias | grep zd1201
-----
+
  * On the target board, load the driver with the device name
+
-----
modprobe usb:v1044p8005d00dc00dsc00dp00ic00isc00ip00in00
-----
+
  * Check if `zd1201` is loaded using `lsmod`
endif::ldd[]
  
=== Module Device Table

  * The list of supported devices is injected in the module info using
    the following macro
+
[source,c]
------
MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE(i2c, my_id)
------
+
  * First argument is the bus type: `i2c`, `pci`, `usb`, ...

  * Second argument is the array of IDs, indicating the supported
    devices

=== Try Out

  * Add a few more device names to id list of our I2C driver
  * Check if they appear in the `modinfo` output
  * Remove the `MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE()` macro invocation build and
    check `modinfo` output
