== Introduction

=== Why write Test Cases?

  * Python's expressiveness and dynamic nature makes it very
    powerful

  * Some times it just too powerful, and wielding it needs care

  * Can you spot the issue in the following code?

[source,python]
------
class ProtocolX:
    def __init__(self, server, username, password):
        self.server = server
	self.username = username
        self.passwd = password

    def reconnect(self, server):
        self._disconnect()
        self.sevrer = server
        self._connect()
------

=== More Examples

  * Such issues are hard to debug, hours are wasted chasing such bugs

  * Typos can lurk within code paths that are seldom taken

  * Causing programs to crash, when they shouldn't

[source,python]
------
def read_file(filename):
    try:
        fp = open(filename)
	data = fp.read()
    except IOError as exc:
        log.err("error reading '%s': %s" % (filenme, exc))
    finally:
        fp.close()
------

=== Too Powerful!

  * Python lacks the safety net of a compiler and static type checking

  * Remember what Uncle Ben said to Peter Parker?

  * Responsible Python programmers, write automated test cases for their
    code

  * Driving the code through all possible code paths, weeding out
    silly typos and regressions

=== E2E vs Unit Testing

  * People generally tend to test their software as a whole
    - Run the program
    - Input data through the UI
    - Check program's response

  * Tests done this way automated or manual is called End-to-End
    Testing

  * E2E Testing is required but not sufficient

=== Drawbacks of E2E Testing

  * It is terribly *slow*
  
    - Accessing database, networks, files, etc. is slow
    - Implication: Will not be run often
    
  * Running test cases has *dependencies*

    - Depends on the availability of test server, input emulators, etc.
    - Implication: Only people with access to resources can execute it

  * Hard to determine *root cause* of failing test

    - Implication: For a large code base, takes time and effort to zero in on the faulty code

=== Drawback of E2E Testing (Contd.)

  * Cannot drive program through all possible code path, *low code coverage*

    - Some error scenarios is almost impossible to create
    - Implication: Low code coverage, and typos lurking in untested code paths

  * E2E tests can be *flaky*

    - Intermittent network failures, power outages, device failures,
      can cause tests to fail
    
    - Implication: Reduces trust on the tests

=== Unit Testing

  * Unit Tests, verify the public interface of a module / class, in
    isolation

  * Dependencies are *mocked* or *faked*

  * Written and executed by developers

=== Advantages of Unit Testing

  * Unit tests are extremely *fast*
    - They do not use databases, network, file system, other applications, console, etc.

  * Unit tests provide *early feedback*
    - No test setup or resources are required to run the tests
    - Developers can run them every time they make a change and before committing the code

=== Advantages of Unit Testing (Contd.)

  * Unit tests makes it easier to *refactor*
    - Any regression due to refactoring, will be caught by unit tests
    - Code can be refactored / improved without the fear of regression

[role="right"]

  * Unit tests verify the *functionality of each unit*

  * Integration tests verify that the *units work together* at the
    sub-system level

  * E2E tests verify that the *product works as a whole*

  * A good test strategy will have, a mix of each approach, with most
    of the testing done at the unit level

== Writing Unit Tests

=== Unit Testing Frameworks

  * Unit testing frameworks provide then necessary infrastructure to

    - Write test cases
    - Run the test cases
    - Generate test reports

  * Available unit testing frameworks

    - `unittest`, part of standard library
    - `py.test`, popular third party framework
    - `nose2`, extends `unittest`, making nicer and easier

=== Requirement

    * In English, the present participle
      - Formed by adding the suffix -ing to the infinite form
      - Example: go -> going

=== Requirement (Contd.)

    * A simple set of heuristic rules can be given as follows:

      - If the verb ends in 'e', drop the 'e' and add 'ing' (if not
       	exception: be, see, flee, knee, etc.)

      - If the verb ends in 'ie', change ie to y and add 'ing'
    
      - For words consisting of consonant-vowel-consonant, double the
        final letter before adding 'ing'

      - By default just add 'ing'

=== Code

[source,python]
------
VOWELS = "aeiou"

def make_ing_form(verb):
    if verb.endswith('ie'):
        return verb[:-2] + 'ying'
    if verb.endswith('e') and (verb[-2].endswith('e') or len(verb) == 2):
        return verb + 'ing'
    if verb.endswith('e'):
        return verb[:-1] + 'ing'
    try:
        if (verb[-3] not in VOWELS) and (verb[-2] in VOWELS) and (verb[-1] not in VOWELS):
            return verb + verb[-1] + 'ing'
    except IndexError:
        pass
    return verb + 'ing' 
------

=== Test Code

[source,python]
------
import lang
print(lang.make_ing_form('go'))
------

=== Try Out

  * Store the function `make_ing_form()` in `lang.py`

  * Create `test_lang.py`, with the code from previous slide

  * Run the test code.

=== Writing a Test Case

[source,python]
------
import lang

def test_default_case():
    word = lang.make_ing_form('go')
    assert word == 'going'
------

=== Try Out

   * Modify `test_lang.py` to include code from previous slide

  * Invoke `py.test`
    - Discovers all files starting with `test_`
    - Looks for functions with `test_`
    - Executes the test
    - Records and prints the results

  * Change the assertion and cause the test to fail

=== One Logical Concept Per Test

[source,python]
------
import lang

def test_default_case():
    word = lang.make_ing_form('go')
    assert word == 'going'

def test_ending_with_e():
    word = lang.make_ing_form('move')
    assert word == 'moving'
------

  * Each test only verifies one logical concept

  * Test functions are named verbosely to indicate what is being tested

=== Try Out

  * Demo: Viewing Line Coverage

  * Add more test cases, to increase coverage
