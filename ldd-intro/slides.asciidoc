=== Road Blocks

  * Learning to write drivers requires good inter-disciplinary
    knowlege:
  
    - Microprocessors
    - Operating Systems
    - POSIX System Calls
    - Linux Kernel Model

== How are we going to do it?

=== Big Picture

  * Day 1: How the Kernel Works

  * Day 2: Device Driver Fundamentals

=== Day 1: How the Kernel Works

  * How Kernel Manages Memory
  * How Kernel Services Work
  * How Kernel Drivers Work
  * How Kernel Manages Files
  * How Kernel Code is Built
  * How Kernel Modules Work
  * How Kernel Manages GPIOs
  * How Kernel Manages Time
  * How Kernel Defers Execution

=== Day 2: Device Driver Fundamentals

  * I2C Interface
  * Writing a Characters
  * Blocking IO
  * Using Interrupts
  * Execution Contexts
  * Concurrency and Locking
  * Bus Model

=== Zen of the Workshop

  * Our Philosophy

    - Provide Meaningful Mental Models
    - Use Examples to Explain Concepts
    - Build Examples Incrementally, Gradually Increasing Complexity
    - Use Simple Devices, Focus on the Driver, Not on the Device
    - Study, Test and Absorb the Example Code
