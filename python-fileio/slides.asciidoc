== Introduction

=== Overview

  * Working with Binary Data

  * Working with Text Files

=== Binary vs Text

  * Computers and programs are supposed to work with binary files
  
  * Human beings are supposed to work with text files

  * Examples?

== Dealing with Binary Data

=== Bytes

  * So far working with Python object

  * Data needs to be stored to disk, or sent to another computer over
    the network

  * Data when stored, needs to be converted to bytes

  * Data when read, needs to be converted to bytes

=== Converting to Bytes

  * `struct` module
+
[source,python]
-------
>>> import struct
>>> struct.pack("I", 156)
b'\x9c\x00\x00\x00'
-------
+
  * First argument `"I"`, specifies that the integer needs to
    represented as a four byte unsigned value

  * Bytes are provided in native endianness, in Intel, little-endian

  * The return value is of type "byte string", more on this later

=== Converting to Bytes (Contd.)

[source,python]
------
>>> struct.pack("H", 156)   # Unsigned Half-Word
b'\x9c\x00'
>>> struct.pack("B", 156)   # Unsigned Byte
b'\x9c'
>>> struct.pack("i", -1)    # Signed Integer
b"\xFE\xFF\xFF\xFF"
>>> struct.pack("<I", 1)    # Unsigned Integer, little-endian
b"\x01\x00\x00\x00"
>>> struct.pack(">I", 1)    # Unsigned Integer, big-endian
b"\x00\x00\x00\x01"
>>> struct.pack("IB", 1, 2)    # Unsigned Integer and a Byte
b'\x01\x00\00\x00\x02'
------

=== Converting from Bytes

  * Re-intrepret a series of bytes
+
[source,python]
------
>>> struct.unpack("HB", b'\x01\00\x02')
(1, 2)
------

[role="two-column"]
=== Writing a File

[role="left"]
[source,python]
------
import struct

fp = open("myfile.dat", "wb")
bytes = struct.pack("BHL", 1, 2, 3)
fp.write(bytes)
fp.close()
------

[role="right"]
   * Open the file first with `open` built-in function

     - Arg 1: filename
     - Arg 2: mode argument, similar to `fopen()`

   * `open()` returns a file object

   * `write()` method, that takes bytes to be written as argument

   * `close()` method, when done

[role="two-column"]
=== Reading a File

[role="left"]
[source,python]
------
import struct

fp = open("myfile.dat", "rb")
bytes = fp.read(7)
print(struct.unpack("BHL", bytes))
fp.close()
------

[role="right"]
   * `read()` method, takes the no. of bytes to read as argument

   * If not specified, reads all the bytes

=== Reading from C

[source,c]
------
#include <error.h>
#include <errno.h>
#include <stdio.h>

struct data {
	unsigned char a;
	unsigned short b;
	unsigned long c;
};

int main()
{
	int ret;
	struct data d;
	FILE *fp = fopen("myfile.dat", "rb");
	if (fp == NULL) {
		error(1, errno, "error opening file myfile.dat");
	}

	ret = fread(&d, sizeof(d), 1, fp);
	if (ret != 1) {
		error(1, errno, "error reading file myfile.dat");
	}

	printf("%d\n", d.a);
	printf("%d\n", d.b);
	printf("%d\n", d.c);

	fclose(fp);
	return 0;
}
------

== Dealing with Text

=== Resource: Tamil Font

  * Some slides use Tamil text, and requires a Unicode Tamil Font

  * Download and Install link:{include:noto-sans-ta.zip.datauri}["Noto
    Sans Tamil Font",filename="noto-sans-ta.zip"]

=== How Text is Represented

  * Restrictions:

    - Computers only work with numbers

    - Data is stored and transferred over the network as bytes

  * Encoding

    - Assign a code to each character to be represented

    - Specify a method store the code, as bytes

=== ASCII Encoding

    * Code assigned to English alphabets, numbers, punctuation marks, etc.

    * Easy to convert to bytes, since code size is only 7-bits

=== Beyond English Alphabets

  * Unicode was created to represent characters from all languages

  * Each character, from every language, is assigned a unique 'code
    point'

  * Needs care while converting to bytes, since code point can be 31-bits

image::figures/utf32-ta-encoding.png[align="center"]

=== UTF-32 Encoding

  * This way of representing Unicode, is called UTF-32 encoding

  * Representing text, in UTF-32, can lead lot of wastage of memory

image::figures/utf32-en-encoding.png[align="center"]

=== UTF-8 Encoding

  * UTF-8 defines a transformation that represents Unicode 1 - 4 bytes

  * Lower code points used frequently are represented using 1 byte

  * Higher code points used less frequently are represented using 4 bytes

=== ASCII vs UTF-8

  * For the first 127 characters ASCII and Unicode assign the same
    code / code points

  * UTF-8 encoding is designed such that the first 127 characters are
    encoded in a single byte

  * So all valid ASCII files, are also valid UTF-8 files

  * UTF-8 encoding is backwards compatible with ASCII

=== Converting Text to Bytes

  * Strings in Python are represented in Unicode
+
[source,python]
------
>>> print("Hello World")
Hello World
>>> print("தமிழ்")
தமிழ்
------
+
  * Provides a mechanism to encode to bytes, using various encodings
+
[source,python]
-------
>>> "அ".encode("utf-8")
b'\xe0\xae\x85'
-------

=== Strings vs Byte Strings

  * Two types of string in Python

    - Byte strings are composed of bytes
    - Strings are composed of Unicode characters

  * Strings should be encoded to bytes before being stored, or sent
    over the network

  * All file and network related code, work with byte strings

  * If a Unicode string is used, encoding needs to be specified

=== Try Out

  * Encode the character "அ" using
    - UTF-32
    - UTF-16
    - UTF-8

  * How many bytes do you get in each case?

  * BOM Character: 0xFEFF

=== Writing a Text File

[source,python]
------
fp = open("myfile.txt", "w", encoding="utf-8")
fp.write("Welcome to Unicode: தமிழ்")
fp.close()
------

=== Reading a File

[source,python]
------
fp = open("myfile.txt", "r", encoding="utf-8")
print(fp.read())
fp.close()
------

  * If encoding is not specified, system specific default encoding
    will be used

  * Trying to decode a UTF-8 text file, as ASCII will result in a
    run-time error

=== Python Source Code and Unicode

  * By default Python 3 assumes source files to be encoded in UTF-8

  * Enables, string literals to be written in any language

  * Comments can also be written in any language

=== Try Out

  * `readline()` method, reads a line of text, from a file

  * `readline()` returns an empty string when EOF is reached

  * Write a program to print atmost 5 lines from a line
